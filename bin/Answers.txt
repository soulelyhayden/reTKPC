People here are talking about Cancer cure here. Stanford Medicine made the biggest breakthrough in history just last month. They cured 90 out of 90 infected mice with different kinds of cancers with just 1 shot of medicine.

Ah man, I got cancer. Can't come to work today, boss.

Pshh go get your shit and get in here!

Thanks to therapy and my sisters' support, I've gone from being suicidal to being hopeful. I'm learning to overcome obstacles that once seemed insurmountable, and I can finally imagine myself living past the next few years.
As long as you're still alive, there's still hope. Life can get better and I'm going to fix mine, dammit!

Using gene therapy to build a human that can drink salt water and use sun light like a plant? Yes I await the day as well.

All 7 of my Honeybee colonies are currently surviving the winter, and today they’re bringing in the first pollen of the year.

The good news is often quiet and subtle. The bad news is always loud. I try to remember that.

Our headlines are splashed with crime yet for every criminal there are 10,000 honest, decent, kindly men. If it were not so, no child would live to grow up. Business could not go on from day to day. Decency is not news. It is buried in the obituaries, but is a force stronger than crime.

This is really beautiful, what is it from?

The possible return of the American Chestnut tree. Fast growing, rot resistant and, perhaps most important, it produces enough calories from the nuts to feed a population.

The death of the American Chesnut is also partially responsible for the severity with which the great depression struck Appalachia.
Chesnuts were a primary food supply for backup reserves in the form of herds of pigs that were allowed free roam.
The pigs could be sold or slaughtered to keep families afloat during hard times.
The disappearance of the chesnuts killed the viability of the pig heards, causing the economic failsafe to collapse ecologically at the same time that the great depression made monetary reserves worthless.

This sounds like a dissertation.

I have been recently diagnosed with stage II Astrocytoma cancer of the brain and spinal cord. Studies like this make me happy for our younger generations that they might not have to see so much suffering.
Thank you for sharing, I needed a lift up and you provided. I am very sorry for your losses. Be well and eat those veggies!

My students. They handle a complex, globally interconnected society in ways "my" generation undergraduate at university in the 1970s couldn't hold a candle to. Any color, any sexual orientation, any disability, any nationality...it's all good, so long as they're not an asshole.
We may be approximating Dr. Martin Luther King's hope for a world where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. Not total, just peripheral. So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.
So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. Required by law in my province of Canada.
My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass.
Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.
Well she did, passed with "Flying colors" the DMV guy said. As a SAR Search and Rescue tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.
1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.
Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.
At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was "home from running around"
Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.
Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.
She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.
Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.
She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.
Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.
By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.
She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.
Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.
I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.
If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.
Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.

I think older drivers definitely need to be retested and have restrictions put on their licence as to driving at night, driving only within certain distances of the home, driving above certain speeds etc. up to and including revocation if found to be impaired to significant degree.
And I'm staring down 70 myself.
In Japan, they have special decals that identify new drivers and the elderly, which I think is a good thing. If you see someone with an elderly tag, you might not assume that driver sees everything you do or reacts as quickly as you do.
I had trouble getting my dad to quit driving because I knew he couldn't see. He couldn't tell me from my daughter from across the room.
I called the DMV for suggestions and the sent him a letter to come in for a vision test.
He passed.
He was in his 90s with cataracts and dementia. We had a lot of rancor over this issue and he ended up living with my brother whom he would actually listen to. And he quit driving.

That's a great idea. I'm going to call my 68 year old congressman and ask him to support such legislation.

Just say "whatup-fam?" Then when they get mad yell "worldstar”.

I am taking my 14 year old daughter and her friends to an Anime convention.
They are all dressing up to cosplay anime characters.
I decided to dress up as Indiana Jones, And I guess that is the worst thing in the workd and now I am an asshole it seems.

You now need to refer to them as ‘weebs’ and pretend you think it’s something positive.

When something surprises you, say you are “shook”

My 13 year old’s most overused term. But if she’s REALLY shook, she’s shookith.

Wuss poppin' Jimbo?

Sweetie, you’re at a critical point in your life. The choices you make now can determine the outcome of your future. This is why I need you to promise me you’ll take school seriously. The sky is the limit if you just try. I only tell you this because I love you and I want you to be woke as fuck.

I try to embarrass my daughter every chance I get as I feel it is truly a dads job to do such things. She unfortunately doesn't react the way I would like. She finds it cool that I'm on top of pop culture. I even went so far as picking her up in my, what I deem an old peoples car, ride with Kendrick Lamar blaring. I was bopping my head, instead of the utter embarrassment her friends started dancing around, and I've become the "cool" dad. Now I've gotta do this all the time when I get her from school. Its also led to her friends coming over all the time and listening to music at top volume. My daughter trolled me while I was trying to troll her. Be careful it backfires.

Say bruh after literally every sentence

Wait till she’s in an argument with your spouse, or being slightly verbose in a public place, pull out your phone and shout “worldstar!”

I read something a little while back about an AI escaping its lab and living on the internet, and subtly manipulating things for the better as it learns about humanity.
I would really like to see that idea expanded on.

Reminds me of some of Asimov's work. There's one where the world is basically run by 2 or 3 enormous mega computers that organize all the goods, services, and labor. There was a part where they're asking it if people were to lie about how much stuff they're producing in a region, or manipulating the numbers to help themselves out. The computer basically says that they all already do that, but that the machine just compensates on the frontend so that when people lie, they still end up producing the computer's desired outcome.

Fed up with apps like Snapchat and Instagram showing you what you're missing out on, a young girl creates an app which shows all the good memories you don't remember.
Mental health problems in the nation diminish significantly as a result.

The young girl grows up. Get's alzheimers. Her relationship with her son is strained. The condition gets worst. She decides to get euthanized because her life is so miserable. The son modifies the app to connect directly with the mother's brain. Dozens of people come to visit, it's all the people her original app has helped. In addition to reliving her own memories the people share highlights of their own. The mother dies happy reminded she lead a good life and helped so many people.

Disease and aging are eliminated by science. The Earth becomes a giant nursery. Once people reach a certain level of maturity, they are sent to forge their destiny among the stars.
The episode would be about the person left on Earth the longest, and their journey to to discover why.

A lonely person finds a not horrible group of people with similar interests and eventually meets up with some of them in real life.

A lonely person codes a virtual reality based on his favorite comics and codes copies of his coworkers through DNA samples to incur his wrath engendered by his maltreatment in the office.
...Wait.

This is one I thought about recently. I believe that Carl Sagan said that we, sentient entities, are a way for the cosmos to know itself. With this in mind, when we think about the end of our universe, whether it be through a big shrink, big cooling, or what have you, we get apprehensive. We probably will never see this end, many of us will be dead. Yet, we still get a cold fear in our hearts. We are also a way for the cosmos to fear it's demise.

Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.

You are not IN the universe, you ARE the universe, an intrinsic part of it. Ultimately you are not a person, but a focal point where the universe is becoming conscious of itself. What an amazing miracle.

We are a long way off from truly understanding the origin and ending of the universe, but we have good theories and time will see that knowledge refined into fact. This is because we live at just the right time.
Remember how galaxies are actually flying apart?
This movement is also accelerating. Galactic structures will fly apart faster and faster. They will eventually exceed the speed at which we could ever hope to travel. They may exceed or match the speed of light! But that means that light shining from these quickly receding galaxies will ever reach us, and no ship could ever catch up to them. They will not see cosmic background radiation. So you couldn't see them with any kind of telescope. You'd see stuff in your local group, and that's it, and you'd think that the universe is a foamy cluster of galaxies that has an ending
Future civilizations may never know the true nature of the universe and could think it finite.

Whales are the biggest creatures in the known universe.

One of my favorite is about the number of unique orders for cards in a standard 52 card deck.
I've seen a a really good explanation of how big 52! actually is.
Set a timer to count down 52! seconds that's 8.0658x1067 seconds
Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years
When you've circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and keep going
When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.
When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.
The 3 left-most digits won't have changed. 8.063x1067 seconds left to go.
You have to repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time. 5.385x1067 seconds left to go.
So to kill that time you try something else.
Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 cards every billion years
Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket
Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon
When the grand canyon's full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest, empty the canyon and carry on.
When Everest has been levelled, check the timer.
There's barely any change. 5.364x1067 seconds left.
You'd have to repeat this process 256 times to have run out the timer.

That every single random event since the dawn of creation. The birth and death of stars, planets and galaxies, the very genesis of life has led to you being here right now to ask this question.

Imagine being transported to a parallel universe that was almost identical to our own.
Somewhere out in the vastness of that universe, there is a tiny planet.
This much is true in both universes.
On this planet, there is a beach, and on that beach, there is a small stone.
Once again, both universes are alike in this regard.
Beneath that stone, however, there are several million grains of sand, and while they are all are in precisely the same location in each universe, one of them – a tiny speck of particularly clear quartz, hewn from a larger whole millions of years before – has a single atom that is positioned a fraction of a femtometer differently than its twin in the mirror dimension.
You may think that such an insignificant difference would label these two universes as being functionally identical, and you would be right. In fact, they are so similar that the multiverse has long since combined them into one reality. That single atom in that tiny speck of sand on that lonesome beach on a distant planet merely occupies two spaces at once, seeming to an outside observer to vibrate back and forth at a predictable rate.
That every atom in existence seems to do the same is probably a coincidence.

A box of avocados in Australia.

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

A 14 year long war in Lichtenstein. Those fuckers have had it too easy for too long.

New plan: Spend $1Trillon on one huge 1 day war. Just send fucking everybody. Launch every missile randomly into the air. Train navy seals to balance beach balls on their nose and send them into combat doing that. Just go nuts for 24 hours.

We're sending all of the soldiers and deploying all of our bombs in the exact same place and time?

Paid off the 2017 deficit and some of the 2016 one. Wouldnt' have mattered though because this year's one is $895 billion so far...
Oh, you could have set up 5000 fully staffed schools for 20 years. you could have got yourself off coal and oil completely as a power source. You could have created a transport system across the USA that is second to none.
You could have sent a man to mars, twice.... twice.

Fix the bridges.

Afghan vet here, I’d have liked to see that money go towards the EPA, education, space exploration, healthcare, actually helping vets, homelessness, bridge repair, virtually anything. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been so wasteful and costly in terms of lives and money spent. Afghanistan at least started with good intentions, but quickly devolved into whatever the fuck it became. I think “clusterfuck with no real objective” is what I’m looking for.
10/10 love this thread.

Solar panels. At roughly $3.14 per watt/h $1 trillion's worth of solar would generate 318,471,337,580 watt/h or 318 Gigawatt /h The US uses about 966 Gigawatts.
So a third of all power could be almost free !
Or you could remove all coal and petroleum generation from the grid.
Or you could give everyone free car charging, which would spur on the auto market, and reduce dependence on the middle East for fuel, improve air quality and lower the medical issues it causes.
Or you know, blow people up in an endless cycle of pain, suffering and misery.
Free healthcare...or free education. Both would probably feed back into the quality of life and prosperity of the country.

I see you've followed my mother-in-law onto the freeway. She gets on the on-ramp, sees a car on the freeway, oh, a half mile back or so, and panics and hits the brakes. Seriously, I don't know how she hasn't caused a wreck or twelve by now.

I had this happen this past year, was driving on the highway and someone up and brought their minivan to a complete STOP in the middle of the damned lane bc they missed their exit. When did people become so dumb, GPS autocorrects for your stupidity just continue on!

My debate teacher in high school was driving us to a competition in a big ol van and missed her exit. It wasn't a big deal. This is one of the main highways in the Kansas City, KS suburbs and you can turn around easily at almost any exit. But she instead decides to THROW IT IN REVERSE in a 70 mph zone and back up about a half mile to our exit with one pair of wheels in the right lane and the other pair on the shoulder. We all had the look of people who had escaped death and the teacher acted like nothing out of the ordinary had taken place. I think the only reason we're still alive is the fact that it was the middle of the day on a weekday in a semi-rural area, so there wasn't much traffic.

How much signal I need to cut across 8 lanes? None? Ok, I turn now. Good luck everybody else!

I assume they have a birthday cake in the car and don’t want to muss the frosting.

Next time you want to flip somebody off on the road, give them a thumbs down instead. It's the I'm not angry, I'm disappointed of driving. It changes your frame of reference from rage at how fucking dumb that guy was to an honest piece of feedback on their maneuver.

My local section of highway has an on-ramp that turns into a quarter-mile exit lane for the next exit. A lot of people get on the highway with the intention of taking the next exit, and simply stay in the lane, never getting up to highway speed because they're getting back off a quarter mile up the road. This is always infuriating because I NEVER take that exit, and am forced to sit behind them while they cruise at 45 mph up to their exit while I'm trying to merge left with cars flying by at 70 mph.

I remember reading that you can calculate a driver's gas mileage VERY accurately solely based on how much they use the brakes not the gas. And that makes sense if you think about it for a second.

When my daughter was little and still believed band-aids cured things, one time she had a belly ache so I put one on her belly and it made her feel better. Power of placebos!

When I was in my old 500+ person building, I kept a stack of papers on my desk. When I was bored, or got tired of sitting down, I'd get up, grab my stack of papers and walk around. I called them my "walking papers" and did this for months. Got a lot of head nods and not one question the entire time. People always assumed I was on an important mission, but nope. Not in the least.
PS: worked on the executive floor / wing, too.

I work at a steel mill and do the same thing when things are slow on day shift. Nobody is going to question or follow the guy carrying a shovel.

Wouldn't they immediately know it's a ruse because there was just one guy and not another 4 to watch you dig?

My husband's boss would always complain to him that he never had enough documents with him when he attended meetings, he now takes in random folders and a stack of papers which he will, occasionally flick through or reshuffle, boss is happy as Larry with hubbys improved performance in meetings.

Take a 1 dollar bill and flip it over. Now tape a 5 dollar bill and tape it to the end of the upside down single with as little tape as possible to make it secure. Now feed the five dollar bill into a change machine. The coin machine reads the five, gives you quarters, then reads the upside down single, rejects that, and boom, you got yourself a felony.

I had a professor in college who, while lecturing, suddenly let out a huge fart. Without pausing, he turned his head as if talking to someone behind him, said "Gesundheit," and continued lecturing as if nothing had happened.
It immediately diffused any potential awkwardness and embarrassment, and I vowed to use the same strategy if the same thing ever happened to me in front of a large crowd of people.

I work in a big corporate building. The same older lady came by everyone’s desk towards the end of the day to collect the trash. Just the sweetest lady ever and every time she’d walk to my desk she’d give me a big smile and ask me how my day was and chat for a minute as she got my trash usually I’d dump it in for her. I had some rough days but she has a way to cheer me up and send me home on a higher note. I know I’m not the only one either.
So then a few weeks back our work implemented a new policy to cut down on trash usage. It’s no longer allowed to have a trash bin at our desk and we have to walk across the room and use the community trash to throw anything away. Not a huge deal but the real reason they did it is so they can cut down on cost... ie the cleaning crew.
Sad to say that I haven’t seen Sharon since.

Electrical contractor of 35, 27 of which are out in the field, we earn PTO hours based upon the number of hours worked in a given week. Full time employees earn what is equal to about 6 extra paid days off in a year., which is typically used for errands, sick days, taking care of children and so on. One of the field employees is a known, to all other field techs, alcoholic, word makes it to office personnel that this individual was using his PTO because he had tipped too many back the night before and couldn’t make it to work on time. Owner denied his PTO claim and he drove into the office to have a shouting match with the owner.
Very next day a company wide email is sent stating that PTO will be indefinitely suspended because it is being abused. Not even sure if what they did is legal. But instead of dealing with this one employee, they decided to use it as a way to save paying out around 180 earned days off throughout the entire company. This happened about a week ago, morale dropped instantly. Most field techs started showing up late playing around on their phones and leaving early. Couple guys have already jumped ship and sounds like a large number of others are about to follow. I’m going to wait it out a couple months as I’m owed a yeti cooler and vacation time on my anniversary.

Small business. 20 employees +/-. Boss made a big speech about austerity measures and no raises this year. A week and a half later he drives up in a brand new Silverado with all the bells and whistles. Expensed to the business of course. He would hate to have to pay taxes on those profits. One of the less subtle members of the staff took a literal shit in front of his office door.

I was dead for 6 minutes. I was laying on the gurney and I was getting colder. Somewhere my body started warming up and everything became really calm and peaceful. I was not longer in pain. All the noise from ER just went away. It was really enjoyable.. I was thinking about my daughter and I was remembering all the things we had done. Slowly it was just black and nothing. There was no knowledge of anything. I explain it as it was like before I was born. Then the worst thing in the world is being revived. I starting hearing loud noises, I felt this massive pain. Then there was the nastiest stench ever. The smell was like every dead animal had crawled in my nose. The smell was so bad I started vommitting. I remember the Dr's turning me on my side and watching my vomit spray on a nurse. Dying was the most pleasant thing I have ever experienced and being revived the worst.

Not really sure what happened and it still freaks me out to this day. May daughter was 4 and developed pneumonia. Her breathing would stop in her sleep so we took her in to the emergency room. She was there for a total of 5 days. For the first 3 days her health kept deteriorating. And on the 3rd day my girlfriend got a call that her mother had collapsed and was taken to the hospital. She was without oxygen for 20 minutes and was declared brain dead. That night my daughter woke up and asked about grandma. No one had said anything to her or in the room with her. We asked her what did she mean. She told us that grandma came to her in a dream and said it's not your time yet. I'll go for you. Immediately the next day she was almost 100 percent better.

I was 19 when I had my first hip replacement surgery, born with a bad hip. The doctor put me under and then all the sudden it was like I was opening my eyes but felt... Nothing.
No pain, no sadness. Nothing.
Apparently I flat lined for 90 seconds due to complications. As I had my eyes 'open' I began to rise out of my body and stand next to it. How freaky is it to see yourself from outside your body? The thing is I never let my left hand let go of my body's left hand.
It felt... Attached
The second I saw the nurse use the, heart starting thing? I was jolted upright - back in my body.

The NDE's that I've looked into pretty much all fall into these categories, so I'd like to hear any others that might not. As you can tell, this interests me greatly!
I want to end this by saying that if you wind up researching NDEs, come to your own conclusions about them. Is there a reason for someone to be pushing a certain belief on you? I have confidence that what people say about their NDE's, they themselves wholly believe to be true. Whether or not you do is up to your own judgement. There are people who make videos and give talks about NDEs they supposedly experience, but to me some seem to be fake and over rehearsed. Take what you want from my spiel, and if you have any questions about this, I've done a fair share of looking into the topic, and would love to discuss further. If you want any directions on where to look first into gaining your own knowledge of NDE's, I can definitely help you find something. Your NDE plug, out.

Sometimes I drive to work in my boat...

I kicked cancers ass!

The love that I feel from my students each work day. I work in an elementary school, and I feel really grateful to have found a job that I love so much. Sometimes I wake up feeling down, but once I step into my workplace and see even one of my students, my morning lights up. This is one of my favorite examples of how loved I feel:
Student: What age do I have to be to be able to go wherever I want?
Me: I think you can pretty much do anything you want once you're 18.
Student: How old will you be when I'm 18?
Me: Hmm... 35?
Student: When I'm 18, and you're 35, can we have dinner together and see each other sometimes?
I almost teared. She might not even remember me when she's 18, but just the thought of her caring so much brings me so much joy.

I found a dollar in my jacket!

Fuck yeah! Immune to mosquitos!

My wife and my son. If I think too hard about how much they mean to me and how lucky I am to have them in my life I feel like crying.

The United States hasn’t minted any new Purple Heart medals since World War II. We’ve been using the stockpile that was prepared in anticipation of a ground invasion of Japan.

We can't prove we aren't in a simulation.

To explain this a little further for those curious:
If we reach a stage where we are capable of creating simulations with this degree of sophistication, then we could run a vast number of them. If each computer could run multiple versions, and even a small number of computers were set up to do so, eventually, at least some of the simulations would develop until the simulated people could run simulations of their own.
Then the simulated2 people could run simulations, and so forth and so on to infinity.
So, if there is one reality and potentially infinite simulations, then it is statistically improbable that we live in reality. Which explains a lot about the last year or so.

Schizophrenia's hallucinations are shaped by culture. Americans with schizophrenia tend to have more paranoid and harsher voices/hallucinations. In India and Africa people with schizophrenia tend to have more playful and positive voices.

All 6 of the stars of Friends negotiated 2% syndication rights for the show. Friends still makes about a billion $ yearly through reruns, Hulu etc. All 6 friends collect a 20 million dollar check annually.
Yes, that means David Schwimmer still gets 20 million dollars a year for doing nothing.
So when you are alone in your 1br apt, watching friends and snickering how any of them are losers who haven’t been famous since, there’s a reason why. They don’t have to work, ever again.

Since its discovery, in 1930, Pluto has not yet made a full orbit of the sun.

Over the space of three days, an estimated 165 people survived both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bomb attacks.
Tsutomu Yamaguchi is one of the more famous ones, who was only two miles from ground zero when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It hit when he was walking to work on the last day of a work trip. After he heard the drone of a plane, he looked up at it and the sky lit up. He was then plucked from the ground, spun around and tossed into a nearby potato field.
Miraculously he survived, despite being covered in burns, soaked in radiation, and with two blown ear drums. He spent a night in an air shelter then took an overnight sleeper train home to Nagasaki to see his family. When he made it to a hospital in Nagasaki he was so burnt a childhood friend didn’t recognise him. Neither did his family.
Despite his wounds he made it to work the next day. He started giving his boss a rundown on what happened, and his boss thought he was crazy. There was no way one bomb could destroy a city. Suddenly, a bright light lit up the room. He panicked and dropped to the floor of the office seconds before the shock wave smashed out the office windows. He had just been hit twice by a nuclear blast in the space of three days.
At the age of 93 he was given the title “nijyuu-hibakusha”, or twice bombed person. He died the next year.
So next time you think you’re having a shitty week at work... yeah.

Google's Deepmind self learning AI "AlphaZero" spent 4 hours learning chess, and proceeded to beat the top chess engine in the world.
The particularly interesting part is that it wins by playing in a very "human" way. Chess engines tend to run algorithms to assess a board after a move is chosen (looking at millions of moves every second) and decide who's better based on a set of parameters, making their play very direct. AlphaZero seemed to develop a far more human playstyle, somehow seeing something less quantifiable that led to an advantage in a position. Over the past 200 years, numerous chess masters studied a style of play similar to AlphaZero.
That means that in 4 hours, AlphaZero developed a better understanding of the game than we could over the 1000+ years it has been studied.

Dad is listening to his daughter say her prayers before bedtime.
She says - God bless mommy and god bless daddy and god bless grandma and... goodbye grandpa.
He asks her - why did you say that?
I don't know, I just felt like saying it.
The next day, grandpa drops dead. Wow, thinks dad, that's an odd coincidence.
A month later at bedtime, the daughter says - God bless mommy and daddy. And goodbye grandma.
Sure enough, the next day grandma breathes her last earthly breath.
The dad realizes this is more than a coincidence, but he is not sure what to do. He doesn't want to disturb his wife by telling her (Grandma and grandpa were her parents).
Months go by and one night the man is listening to his daughter saying her prayers at bedtime - God bless mommy....she turns her head and looks straight at him - and goodbye daddy. What!? are you sure honey? She nods. The man's heart begins racing and he breaks out in a sweat. He is so upset, he can't sleep at all that night.
The next day he goes off to work, but locks himself in his office. He takes the phone off the hook, cancels all his meetings and awaits the inevitable.
He stays at work past 5 because he feels secure there. He watches the hours tick by. Finally it is midnight and, drenched in sweat, he realizes he has cheated death. He drives home drenched in sweat and with all his nerves frazzled.
His wife is up and waiting for him - Where the hell were you today??! He replies - Don't shout, I've had an absolutely miserable day.
His wife then says - You had a miserable day? I'm the one who had a miserable day! First, the milkman drops dead on the steps...

A man walks into a bar...
He goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.
The bartender says, Sure, I'll take a bet. What's your action?
The man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. The bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.
Laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. Double or nothin' says I can bite my other eye.
The bartender thinks it over. He knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.
The man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.
Now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. Just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.
Real sorry about that, pal. I get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so I'll give you another chance to win some cash. I've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, I can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. This is kinda hard for me to do, though, so I think it's fair if you give me two chances at it.
The bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. Especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. After a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.
The man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, "Go!" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.
The man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. However, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.
Catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. Once again, he shouts, "Go!" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar.
Once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. However, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass.
Head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.
All of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams "Fuck!" at the top of his lungs.
The bartender mutters aloud, I wonder what his problem is.
To which the man replies, Oh, I just bet that guy $10,000 that I could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy.

Two hobos were walking down the tracks. They encounter a mangy old dog sitting in the middle of the tracks, contorted into that weird position and licking his nuts. One hobo says wistfully, Gee, I wish could do that. His companion replies, Well, maybe you should start by petting him first.

My dad asked me the other day: Are you even listening to me?
Which is a really weird way to start a conversation if you ask me.

I arranged a threesome on the weekend.
Had two no shows, but I still had fun.

Three guys are walking through the woods when they find a lamp. One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes. The first guy immediately blurts out I want a billion dollars. POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says I want to be the richest man alive. POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life. POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth. POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want. POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die. POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die. POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever. POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth. POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years. Second guy smiles and says Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed. Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: Guys, I think I fucked up.
